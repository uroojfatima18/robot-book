# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 1 - The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

| Category             | Status | Notes                                            |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Content Quality      | PASS   | Spec is business-focused, no tech stack details  |
| Requirement Complete | PASS   | All requirements testable, no clarifications     |
| Feature Readiness    | PASS   | 4 user stories cover Beginner to Advanced tiers  |

## Notes

- Specification covers educational content creation (textbook chapter)
- Three-tier structure (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) is well-defined
- Code examples in user input are part of the CONTENT to be included, not implementation
- All success criteria focus on reader outcomes, not system metrics
- Ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
