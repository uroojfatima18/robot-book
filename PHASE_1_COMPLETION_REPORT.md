## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Chapter 4 Completion (Recommended Next)
**Goal**: Complete missing intermediate and advanced tiers
**Estimated Time**: 30-40 hours
**Priority**: HIGH - Chapter is 33% complete, needs 67% more content

**Tasks**:
1. Complete Beginner tier (add B3 lesson, exercises)
2. Create complete Intermediate tier (3 lessons + exercises + code)
3. Create complete Advanced tier (3 lessons + exercises + code)
4. Add diagrams and supporting materials
5. Create AI prompts for all tiers
6. Add summary.md

### Phase 3: Chapter 5 Creation (Critical Gap)
**Goal**: Create complete chapter from scratch
**Estimated Time**: 40-60 hours
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Chapter has zero content

**Tasks**:
1. Define chapter scope (Adaptive Robotics)
2. Create all core documentation
3. Create all three tiers with lessons
4. Add exercises, code, diagrams
5. Create AI prompts
6. Complete supporting materials

### Phase 4: Polish & Enhancement (Quality Improvement)
**Goal**: Improve overall book quality
**Estimated Time**: 10-15 hours
**Priority**: MEDIUM - After Chapters 4-5 are complete

**Tasks**:
1. Add missing diagrams
2. Code quality review
3. Add troubleshooting sections
4. Cross-chapter consistency check

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action
**Proceed to Phase 2: Chapter 4 Completion**

Rationale:
- Chapter 4 has existing foundation (beginner tier with 2 lessons)
- Building on existing work is faster than starting from scratch
- High impact - completes a partially-done chapter
- Provides momentum for Phase 3 (Chapter 5)

### Resource Allocation
If multiple contributors are available:
- **Track 1**: Phase 2 (Chapter 4 completion)
- **Track 2**: Phase 3 (Chapter 5 creation)
- **Track 3**: Phase 4 (Polish and enhancement)

This parallel approach could complete all phases in 3-4 weeks instead of 6 weeks.
