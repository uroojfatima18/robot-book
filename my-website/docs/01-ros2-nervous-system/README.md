## Chapter Overview

Welcome to Chapter 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This chapter introduces ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) as the foundational "nervous system" that enables robots to perceive their environment, process information, and execute actions.

Just as the human nervous system coordinates sensory input with motor output, ROS 2 provides the communication infrastructure that connects sensors, processors, and actuators in robotic systems.

**This is a complete, progressive learning experience** that takes you from zero ROS 2 knowledge to building production-grade robot architectures.

---

## Chapter Learning Outcomes

By the end of this entire chapter, you will be able to:

1. **Understand** ROS 2 architecture and its central role in robotics
2. **Install** ROS 2 on your system and verify it works
3. **Create** Python nodes that communicate via pub/sub
4. **Build** services and action servers for robot control
5. **Design** robot descriptions in URDF format
6. **Visualize** robots in simulation (RViz2, Gazebo)
7. **Implement** production-grade ROS 2 architectures
8. **Debug** complex ROS 2 systems using professional tools
9. **Integrate** AI concepts with ROS 2 infrastructure
