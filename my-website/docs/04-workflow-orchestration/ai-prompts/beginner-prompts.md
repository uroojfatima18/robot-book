# Beginner AI Prompts for Workflow Orchestration

Use these prompts with your AI assistant to deepen understanding of workflow orchestration concepts.

---

## Conceptual Understanding

### Pipelines and Data Flow

**Prompt 1: Basic Pipeline Explanation**
```
Explain what a robotic pipeline is using a real-world analogy.
How is it similar to an assembly line in a factory?
```

**Prompt 2: Flow Pattern Comparison**
```
Compare sequential, parallel, and conditional flow patterns in robotics.
Give me an example of when I would use each one.
```

**Prompt 3: Data Handoff**
```
Explain how data moves between components in a robotic pipeline.
What happens if one component is slower than the others?
```

### State Machines

**Prompt 4: State Machine Basics**
```
Explain state machines as if I'm completely new to robotics.
Use a simple example like a vending machine or traffic light.
```

**Prompt 5: When to Use State Machines**
```
When should I use a state machine versus simple if-else logic?
Give me 3 scenarios where state machines are clearly better.
```

**Prompt 6: State Machine Components**
```
Explain the difference between states, transitions, events, and actions
in a state machine. How do they work together?
```

### Triggers

**Prompt 7: Trigger Types**
```
Explain the different types of triggers in robotic workflows:
time-based, event-based, condition-based, and manual.
Give me a robotics example for each.
```

**Prompt 8: Trigger Priority**
```
What happens when multiple triggers fire at the same time?
How should a robot prioritize different triggers?
```

## Visualization and Diagrams

**Prompt 9: Pipeline Visualization**
```
Draw a text-based diagram of a robot navigation pipeline with these components:
- LIDAR sensor
- Obstacle detector
- Path planner
- Motor controller
Show how data flows between them.
```

**Prompt 10: State Machine Diagram**
```
Create a state machine diagram for a delivery robot with these states:
IDLE, NAVIGATING, DELIVERING, RETURNING, CHARGING, ERROR
Show all possible transitions.
```

**Prompt 11: Workflow Comparison**
```
Compare two approaches to robot navigation:
1. Simple sequential pipeline
2. State machine-based approach
What are the pros and cons of each?
```

---

## Problem-Solving

**Prompt 12: Pipeline Design**
```
I need to design a pipeline for a robot that picks up objects.
What components do I need? How should they be connected?
Walk me through the design process.
```

**Prompt 13: State Machine Design**
```
Help me design a state machine for a cleaning robot.
What states should it have? What triggers the transitions?
```

**Prompt 14: Failure Scenarios**
```
What can go wrong in a robotic pipeline?
List 5 common failure scenarios and how to handle them.
```

---

## Code Understanding

**Prompt 15: Python State Machine**
```
Explain this state machine code line by line:
[paste the traffic light example from the lesson]
How does it track state and handle transitions?
```

**Prompt 16: Pipeline Code**
```
Explain this pipeline code:
[paste the pipeline simulation example]
How does data flow from one function to the next?
```

**Prompt 17: Conditional Logic**
```
Explain how conditional flow works in this code:
[paste the conditional pipeline example]
How does the robot make decisions?
```

---

## Debugging Help

**Prompt 18: Pipeline Not Working**
```
My robotic pipeline isn't working correctly. The data from the sensor
reaches the planner, but the controller doesn't respond.
What could be wrong? How do I debug this?
```

**Prompt 19: State Machine Stuck**
```
My state machine gets stuck in one state and won't transition.
What are common reasons for this? How do I fix it?
```

**Prompt 20: Trigger Not Firing**
```
I set up a trigger to detect low battery, but it never fires.
What should I check? How do I test triggers?
```

---

## Extension and Exploration

**Prompt 21: Complex Workflows**
```
How do real-world robots handle complex workflows with many components?
Explain hierarchical state machines or behavior trees at a beginner level.
```

**Prompt 22: Multi-Robot Coordination**
```
How would pipelines and state machines work for multiple robots
working together? What changes?
```

**Prompt 23: Real-World Examples**
```
Give me 3 real-world examples of robotic workflows:
1. In manufacturing
2. In healthcare
3. In autonomous vehicles
Explain the pipeline and state machine for each.
```

---

## Analogies and Metaphors

**Prompt 24: Restaurant Analogy**
```
Explain a robotic workflow using a restaurant analogy.
How is a robot like a restaurant kitchen? What are the "stations"?
```

**Prompt 25: Traffic System Analogy**
```
Compare a robotic workflow to a city traffic system.
How are traffic lights, roads, and cars like robot components?
```

---

## Concept Connections

**Prompt 26: ROS 2 Connection**
```
How do pipelines and state machines relate to ROS 2 concepts
like nodes, topics, and services? Connect the dots for me.
```

**Prompt 27: Simulation Connection**
```
How do workflows work differently in simulation versus real hardware?
What should I be aware of?
```

**Prompt 28: AI Integration**
```
How would AI/ML components fit into a robotic pipeline?
Where would they go in the workflow?
```

---

## Self-Assessment

**Prompt 29: Check My Understanding**
```
I think I understand pipelines and state machines. Can you quiz me?
Ask me 5 questions to test my understanding.
```

**Prompt 30: Concept Summary**
```
Summarize the key concepts of workflow orchestration in 5 bullet points.
What are the most important things I should remember?
```

## Tips for Using These Prompts

1. **Be Specific**: Add details about your specific scenario or robot
2. **Ask Follow-ups**: Don't hesitate to ask "why?" or "how?"
3. **Request Examples**: Ask for concrete examples when concepts are unclear
4. **Iterate**: Refine your questions based on the responses you get
5. **Connect to Your Work**: Relate concepts to your own projects
