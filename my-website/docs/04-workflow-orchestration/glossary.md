# Chapter 4: Workflow Orchestration - Glossary

## A

**Action**: A ROS 2 communication pattern for long-running tasks with feedback and goal management.

## F

**Fallback Path**: An alternative execution path that activates when a primary process fails.

**Finite State Machine (FSM)**: A computational model consisting of a finite number of states, transitions between those states, and actions based on inputs.

**Failure Recovery**: The process of restoring normal operation after a system failure.

## L

**Launch File**: A ROS 2 configuration file that defines how to start multiple nodes with specific parameters and remappings.

## P

**Pipeline**: A sequence of connected processing stages that transform data from input to output.

**Process Pipeline**: A series of interconnected processes where the output of one process becomes the input to the next.

## S

**State Machine**: A computational model that represents a system with a finite number of states and transitions between those states.

**Supervisor**: A monitoring component that oversees the health and operation of other system components.

## W

**Watchdog**: A monitoring component that detects failures and triggers recovery mechanisms.

## Y

**YAML**: A human-readable data serialization format commonly used for ROS 2 configuration files.
